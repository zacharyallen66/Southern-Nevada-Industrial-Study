## 📘 Project Overview
This analysis supports the 2024 Southern Nevada Regional Industrial Study through original data analysis and visualizations focused on Clark County’s freight infrastructure and commodity flows. It uses Transearch data spanning 2015, 2019, 2021, and projections to 2050 to inform regional planning and economic policy decisions.

My contribution included the end-to-end construction of all freight transportation visualizations, covering modes, flows, trade relationships, and spatial summaries. These are featured across pages 111–120 of the final report, with additional unpublished material provided here for reference.

## 📊 Key Features

- 📦 **Freight Commodity Flow Analysis**  
  Processed and visualized total value and tonnage of goods transported to/from/within Clark County.

- 🔄 **Mode Share Charts (All Directions)**  
  Created circular and bar charts showing trends in freight transport by truck, rail, air, etc., from 2015 to 2050.

- 🌐 **Regional Trade Mapping**  
  Visualized Clark County’s largest domestic trade partners and mapped commodity flow origins by region/state.

- 📈 **Time Series & Trendlines**  
  Built projections and charts highlighting changes in outbound, inbound, intra-county, and through traffic by mode and commodity.

- 🗺️ **Geospatial Economic Summaries**  
  Aggregated freight data by FIPS regions for use in spatial summaries and visual heatmaps.
